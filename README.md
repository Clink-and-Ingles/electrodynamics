Code for simulating electrodynamic physics

1. Lean OpenCL basics
2. Implement minimal working version (1D, free space, basic grid)
    - including data saving and interactive terminal
3. Learn Vulkan basics  
4. Implement vector field rendering
    - including interactivity like pan and rotate
    - use quaternions for rotation handling?
5. Implement regular grids for 1D, 2D, 3D
    - including lazy evaluation, Yee grid <-> regular grid conversion
6. Implement some basic Boundary Conditions
    - including absorptive boundary and pulse insertion
7. Add polarization field
    - initially history independent
    - later add response function and or dynamical simulation of P (anharmonic oscillator)

Waaaay later, add in FEM simulation for generality, although more difficult to make work and less efficient, it is widely used.
